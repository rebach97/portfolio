      From April 2020 to June 2021, I worked a team of about 10 news assistants and student freelancers, along with reporter Timothy Williams, to cover the pandemic's impact on people in prisons and jails. Our team (we called ourselves the "Prison Peeps") was part of a broader 100+ person project that received the 2021 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. For much of the pandemic, we spent at least three days a week logging coronavirus cases and clusters by hand, taking note of trends and reporting out breaking stories and larger enterprise and investigative projects. 
      <p><i>Below is a sampling of some of the work I contributed to.</i></p></div>

        Mississippi Prison Officials Tout Low Rates of Covid. The Reason May Be Fewer Tests.
      </a>
      <div class="story-desc">
        I took the lead on this story about Mississippi prisons, which for months were not releasing death counts and had abysmally low testing numbers. After pushing for answers and speaking with several inmates inside, Mississippi prison officials finally revealed the death toll to the public.
