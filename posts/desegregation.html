        On the 60th anniversary of Brown v. Board, then-Propublica reporter Nikole Hannah-Jones arrived at my high school newspaper class, enlisting our help with a groundbreaking project, "<a href = "https://www.propublica.org/article/segregation-now-full-text" target = blank><u>Segregation Now</u></a>," which explored racial resegregation in my local school district and others across the country. Our student photos were <a href = "https://archive.nytimes.com/lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/17/bridging-the-racial-divide-in-tuscaloosa-schools/" target = blank><u>published by The New York Times</u></a> and displayed at a local art gallery.
        <p>After the story ran, I and a team of student reporters set out to establish a cross-district exchange program, where students from two of the district's high schools would swap schools for a few days and document their experiences. I wrote about the project in a       <a href="https://www.tuscaloosanews.com/story/opinion/columns/guest/2015/07/26/guest-columnist-young-people-cant-wait-on-change/29961044007/" target="_blank"><u>column for the Tuscaloosa News</u></a>, and we were later asked to speak about our work at national and state conferences.</p>
        <p><i>Nikole is the reason I'm a journalist today. She taught me to find the historical through-lines and approach each story with a critical lens, no matter how small. At AL.com, I kept a close eye on a number of desegregation cases unfolding across the state, 70 years later. This is just a small sampling of that coverage.</i></p>

        60 Years After Integrating Alabama Schools, 3 Students Remember
      </a>
      <div class="story-desc">
        On the 60th anniversary of school desegregation in the state, AL.com set out to create is the first known repository of oral histories from the students who integrated schools across the state in 1963. I traveled hours to different corners of the state with a video team to interview former students. The project, called "Season of Change" supported other stories commemorating events in Birmingham and elsewhere. A University of Alabama education professor wrote to me after this story ran, saying that she would make it required reading for her students.
