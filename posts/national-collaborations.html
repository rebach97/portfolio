        Tackling Teacher Shortages
      </a>
      <div class="story-desc">
        I contributed two stories to this national collaboration on teacher shortages: one, with the Associated Press, <a href = "https://www.al.com/educationlab/2022/09/teacher-shortages-in-alabama-us-are-real-but-not-for-the-reason-you-heard.html" target = blank><u>that examined hiring patterns and vacancies</u></a>, as well as a feature on an Alabama school district trying to <a href = "https://www.al.com/educationlab/2022/10/tackling-teacher-shortages-influx-of-english-learners-prompts-change-in-alabama-school-district.html" target = blank><u>bridge Spanish-speaking staffing gaps</u></a>. My coverage of English learners was highlighted by Education Writers Association judges, who recognized the package as a finalist for collaborations at the organization's national seminar.<br></br>
