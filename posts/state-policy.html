        Alabama Retired Teachers Struggle with Rising Costs, Stagnant Pensions: 'Can't Plan'
      </a>
      <div class="story-desc">
        Alabama's retired teachers have not seen their retirement checks change since 2009. For this collaboration with the Alabama Reflector, I spoke with numerous retired educators about how they were handling rising costs and threats to healthcare premiums. This story was cited in legislative meetings during the following session, as lawmakers worked to create a new system for approving cost-of-living-increases.

        College Offices Closed, Websites Scrubbed: How Alabama's Anti-DEI Law Kicks In

        Since my second week on the job at AL.com, I've closely followed the evolution of anti-CRT and anti-DEI laws in the state.

I <a href = "https://www.al.com/educationlab/2021/08/alabama-teachers-students-fear-critical-race-theory-resolution-could-hamper-needed-discussions.html" target = blank><u>spoke with educators</u></a> and <a href = "https://www.al.com/news/2022/02/inside-one-of-alabamas-only-black-history-high-school-classes-what-is-taught.html" target = blank><u>sat in classrooms</u></a>.

        <p>The story above was one of the first to trace the initial impacts of state legislation, weeks before the law kicked in. Two key sources in the story were later recruited by the NAACP to participate in an ongoing lawsuit against the University of Alabama and the state.</p>

        Advocates said my watchdog coverage of education budget changes helped pressure lawmakers to fund summer meals for children.
